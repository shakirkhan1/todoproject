This project was made using HTML5, CSS3 and JS.
One can add some key-notes and can view it by button provided.

Each time if a user click on the header, color of the header as well as
background color of whole body will change.
The color picked will be a random color.

If one clicks on the "+" plus icon on todo-header, information related to this todoapp will be shown.
